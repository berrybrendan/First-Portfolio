        <!--Bio-->
        <p class="p1">My name is Brendan Berry, and I was born and raised in Encinitas, California. I graduated high school in 2015, and got accepted into Northern Arizona University. I spent two years in classes 
        there until I realized that style of learning wasn't for me. I used my time in university to take classes that piqued my interest, but I still wasn't sure about what I wanted to do until I started learning about coding and 
        computer science.
        </p>    
        <p class="p2">Ever since I was young, I always had an interest in technology and how it works. As I grew up, I was always playing games and learning about new tech being invented, however, 
        it wasn't until I took these classes that I truly understood how important coding really is.
        I've always been interested in what's behind the scenes of the games and techology I grew up using and now that I'm finally getting into the field, I am very excited.
